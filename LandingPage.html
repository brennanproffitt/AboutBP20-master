                <h4>About Me:</h4>
                <p>My name is Brennan Proffitt. I am currently an undergraduate student at Pittsburg State University and I
                am
                seeking a Bachelor of Business Administration with a major in Computer Information Systems. I have
                learned a
                lot during my time at PSU, and some of my favorite classes have involved developing mobile and web
                applications, as
                well as designing relational databases.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Work History:</h4>
                <p>Throughout my undergraduate program, I have been working at The Home Depot as a part-time associate. I
                spent
                three years as a sales associate for the lumber and millwork departments and gained lots of skills and
                knowledge when it comes to home improvement projects. While what I've learned as an associate is not
                directly related to my degree, I have been able to develop strong interpersonal and communication skills
                that are applicable to any career. I am still working with The Home Depot, but I am now on the
                Merchandising Execution Team. We are responsible for carrying out various projects and servicing
                merchandised bays to help sell and keep track of product. It is certainly a different aspect of the
                company,
                but I've loved it so far. Many of the projects require hands on use of tools as well as problem solving
                when
                issues occur.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Personal Life:</h4>
                <p>Outside of work and school I enjoy spending time with friends and family, listening to music, playing
                the drums and guitar, and playing video games. Navigate this webpage for more information about me,
                including links to my social media, YouTube channel, Xbox Profile, and more!</p>
